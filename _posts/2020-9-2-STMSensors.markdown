title: High-G Accelerometer and IMU Drivers
objective: To develop functional SPI drivers for the H3LIS331DL High-G accelerometer and LSM9DS1 IMU.
details: The drivers are written in C (because it is more lightweight than C++) and tested on the STM32 platform using the STMCubeIDE. The sensor configuration and data is stored in structs using a similar scheme for both chips.
results: This was my first time writing sensor drivers and working at such a low level. I was able to first write a I2C driver for the High-G accelerometer. Once I was comfortable with my ability to work with I2C, I updated the driver for SPI and wrote the IMU driver for SPI. These drivers are currently deployed on the FCBâ€™s the club is developing and have been used to collect data from several flights.
