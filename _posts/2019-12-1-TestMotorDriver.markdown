title: Motor Driver Test Board
objective: To create a board to test 4 different DC motor drivers including some external gate drivers for the Roverâ€™s drive system.
details: The board tested the BTS7960, DRV8701, VNHD7012AY, and DRV8873. Each motor driver contains an internal or external H-Bridge to allow for full speed control in both directions. Since this driver would be deployed for the drive system, it needed to be able to handle high current loads.
results: Although there were some issues on the board, all drivers were able to be tested with some rework. We also performed thermal testing with the motor stalled on the BTN7960 and DRV8701 to compare how the fully integrated driver fared against the external gate driver. The DRV8701 was then chosen and the final drive board for the rover used the same circuit.
