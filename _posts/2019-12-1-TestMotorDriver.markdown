title: Motor Driver Test Board
objective: To create a board to test four DC motor drivers, including some external gate drivers for the roverâ€™s drive system.
details: The board tested the BTS7960, DRV8701, VNHD7012AY, and DRV8873. Each motor driver contains an internal or external H-Bridge to enable speed control in both directions. Since the rover team would deploy it in the drive system, it needed to handle high current loads.
results: Although there were some issues on the board, we were able to test all drivers after some rework. We also performed thermal testing with the motor stalled on the BTN7960 and DRV8701 to compare the fully integrated driver against the external gate driver. After testing, we chose the DRV8701; and the final drive board for the rover used the circuit I designed.
