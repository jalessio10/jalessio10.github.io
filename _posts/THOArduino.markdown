title: Through-Hole Arduino
objective: To create a fully functional arduino utilizing almost entirely THO components in order to introduce new members to soldering.
details: The board uses a THO variant of the ATMega328P, the supporting circuitry also almost entirely uses THO components. On the bottom is a FT230X for serial communication and programming using the Arduino bootloader. This serial converter (and supporting circuitry), and the USB port are the only SMT components on the PCB. The board also features some programmable LEDs and a mini-speaker.
results: We were able to send these boards as kits to students of our intro program and teach them how to solder it over Zoom. After the workshop was complete all 20 or so boards assembled by students were able to work after some basic troubleshooting. This included reflowing some solder joints and, for one board, reflashing the bootloader.
