category: Rocketry
title: L1 Certification Rocket
objective: To successfully design and fly an L1 certification rocket with electronic deployment in under three weeks.
details: I simulated the rocket in OpenRocket and designed it in Solidworks. I built the airframe using Blue Tube, a plastic nosecone, laser-cut plywood fins, and RocketEpoxy. The electronics bay used a Blue Tube coupler, laser-cut plywood, and 3D printed bulkheads. The electronics bay contained two fully redundant systems with an Altus Metrum Easy Minis, a 1s lipo battery, and a rocker switch for arming. I designed the rocket to deploy a small drogue parachute at apogee and a larger main parachute a few hundred feet off the ground using black powder charges and shear pins.
results: Although the rocket's flight was imperfect, it was undamaged and safely recovered, earning me my L1 rocketry certification. I completed the project without delay to fly at that month's launch.
