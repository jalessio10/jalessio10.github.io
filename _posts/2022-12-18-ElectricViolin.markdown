objective: To create a violin perfect for practicing at home.
details: I decided to go electric so I don't need a resonating body, making the instrument very quiet until plugged into an amplifier; which can easily be plugged into either headphones or a speaker. This makes it perfect for someone with roommates. I decided on a pickup that is integrated into a violin bridge for superior sound and permanent fixture to the instrument. I assembled the completed design using sla printed parts (using Formlabs Rigid and Tough resins) and off the shelf parts.
results: The finished instrument looks beautiful and sounds great through a speaker amp! But is still whisper quiet when unplugged. It is a bit heavy because of the glass-filled resin, but otherwise feels familiar to a traditionally crafted violin.
