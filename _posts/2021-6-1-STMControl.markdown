title: STM32 Control Board
objective: To create an STM32 board with detent locking connectors for entry in the NASA Mars Ice Challenge.
details: The board utilized an STM32 Microcontroller and JST-PH connectors. The board provided flexibility so they could be used in various systems for basic IO without needing to make many custom boards. The connection provided by the JST connectors also minimized the risk of wires coming loose.
results: A few of the boards were used in various parts of the final drill system and the team won second place in the competition overall.
