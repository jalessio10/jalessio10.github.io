title: Portfolio Website
objective: To create a portfolio website that is easy to maintain inexpensively.
details: I decided to avoid using all-in-one website-building platforms like Wix because they require a monthly subscription. Instead, my website is hosted for free using Github Pages; meaning all I would have to pay for would be a domain name. To build the website I found and modified a free Jekyll template called Freelancer from Bootstrap.
results: If you are seeing this post, then I have properly configured the DNS for my domain. Further, I must have created a Jekyll website that can be built by Github pages!
