category: Web Design
title: Portfolio Website
objective: To create a portfolio website that is easy to maintain inexpensively.
details: I decided to avoid using all-in-one website building platforms such as wix because they require a monthly subscription. Instead, my website is hosted for free using Github pages. This meant all I would have to pay for would be a domain name. To build the website I found and modified a free jekyll template called Freelancer from Bootstrap. 
results: If you are seeing this post, then I have properly configured the DNS for my domain and created a jekyll website that can be built by Github pages!
