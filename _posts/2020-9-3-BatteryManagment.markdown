title: Battery Managment System for 6s lipos
objective: To create two test boards to evaluate a LiPo charging/management and balancing IC from Texas Instruments. AeruspaceNU will eventually use the design to safely maintain the charge of a 6S lipo in a rocket as it sits on the pad before launch.
details: AerospaceNU will deploy this system on the Redshift rocket they are currently developing, which will use the club's first liquid rocket engine. The propulsion system will use 6S LiPos to power its solenoid valves. These test boards utilize the BQ77PL900 balancer IC and BQ24616 charge controller.
results: The boards were successfully able to charge a 6S lipo and keep the cells in balance. However, there is more testing to be done before the system is deployed. In particular, whether the batteries will stay balanced after many charge cycles.
