title: Battery Managment System for 6s lipos
objective: To create two test boards to evaluate a LiPo charging/management and balancing IC from Texas Instruments. The design will eventually be used to safely maintain the charge of a 6S lipo in a rocket as it sits on the pad before launch.
details: This system will be deployed on the Redshift rocket being developed by AerospaceNU, which will use the club's first custom liquid rocket engine. 6S LiPos will be used to power the solenoid valves needed for the custom propulsion system. These test boards utilize the BQ77PL900 balancer IC and BQ24616 charge controller.
results: The boards were successfully able to charge a 6S lipo and keep the cells in balance. However, there is more testing to be done before the system is deployed. In particular, whether the batteries will stay balanced after many charge cycles.
