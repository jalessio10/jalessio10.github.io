title: Battery Managment System for 6s lipos
objective: To create two test boards to evaluate a lipo charging/management and balancing IC from TI that would eventually be used to safely maintain charge of a 6S lipo in a rocket as it sits on the pad prior to launch.
details: This system will be deployed on the Redshift rocket being developed by AerospaceNU, which will use the clubs first custom liquid rocket engine. 6S lipos will be used to power the solenoid valves needed for the custom propulsion system. These test boards utilize the BQ77PL900 balancer IC and BQ24616 charge controller.
results: The board was successfully able to charge a 6S lipo and seems to keep the cells in balance, though there is more testing that should be done before the system is deployed.
