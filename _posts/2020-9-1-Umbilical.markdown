title: Rocket Umbilical - Electrical Interface
objective: To create an electrical interface for charging batteries and communicating with electronics while they are inside the rocket.
details: Mill-Max pogo pins were used for carrying the high current for battery charging while Bourns spring-loaded connectors were used for communicating with the electronics. These connectors were fitted onto a PCB and fitted into a 3D printed enclosure. The two sides are held together by magnets so that if the umbilical can be easily detached manually or by the rocket.
results: Prototype has been completed and functional testing has been done. It has not been fitted into a rocket yet because charging batteries on the launch pad has been deprioritized until the club starts to get ready to fly its liquid rocket engine.
