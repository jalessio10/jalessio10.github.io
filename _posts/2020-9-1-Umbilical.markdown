title: Rocket Umbilical - Electrical Interface
objective: To create an electrical interface for charging batteries and communicating with electronics while they are inside the rocket.
details: I used Mill-Max pogo pins for carrying the high current for battery charging. In addition, I used Bourn's spring-loaded connectors for communicating with the electronics. These connectors were fitted onto a PCB and put into a 3D-printed enclosure. The two sides are held together by magnets so that the umbilical can be easily detached manually or by the rocket.
results: Prototyping and functional testing are completed. It has not been fitted into a rocket yet because charging batteries on the launch pad has been deprioritized until the club starts to get ready to fly its liquid rocket engine.
