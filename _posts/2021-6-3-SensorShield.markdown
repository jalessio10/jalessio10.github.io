title: Arduino Sensor Shield
objective: To design a shield for the Arduino R3 for teaching surface mount soldering and as a tool for software development.
details: The shield was initially designed for a 9-axis imu, a barometer, and a Micro SD card reader. Due to supply chain issues we wound up with a LIS2DE12 3-axis accelerometer and a MS5607 barometer as our sensors, which were connected for I2C.
results: A few fully functioning sensor shields were assembled with newer club members, though they proved more difficult to assmble then anticipated due to the tiny accelerometer. Even the more experienced members of the club such as myself had trouble. The shields proved useful for developing flight control software with datalogging for the basic Arduino altimeter being developed by new club members.
