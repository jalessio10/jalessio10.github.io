title: Arduino Sensor Shield
objective: To design a shield for the Arduino R3 for teaching surface mount soldering and as a tool for software development.
details: We initially planned to use a 9-axis imu, a barometer, and a Micro SD card reader. Due to supply chain issues, I used a LIS2DE12 3-axis accelerometer and an MS5607 barometer. The sensors were connected with I2C.
results: A few fully functioning sensor shields were assembled with newer club members, though it proved more challenging to build up than anticipated due to the tiny accelerometer. Even the more experienced members of the club such as myself had trouble. The shields proved useful for developing Arduino-based flight control software with data logging.
