title: Coin Counter/Sorter
objective: To create a device that could sort coins, count them, and display that information on an LCD.
details: I used an Arduino Nano for the controller and soldered all the parts to a perfboard. I designed A laser-cut chassis and a 3D printed sorting mechanism for the build. To detect coins, I added a laser diode and photoresistor pair to each coin drop and the coin funnel. The sorting mechanism was controlled by a small DC motor. 
results: The final electronics and software worked flawlessly. Although, there were some issues with the mechanical mechanism, which could occasionally get clogged due to the varying thicknesses of US coins.
