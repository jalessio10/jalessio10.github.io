title: Coin Counter/Sorter
objective: To create a device that could sort coins, count them, and display that information on an LCD.
details: The device is powered by an Arduino Nano and all the parts are soldered to a perfboard. A laser-cut chassis and 3D printed sorting mechanism were utilized for the build. To detect coins, a laser diode and photoresistor pair were added to each coin drop and the coin funnel. The sorting mechanism was controlled by a small DC motor. 
results: The final electronics and software worked flawlessly. Although there were some issues with the mechanical mechanism, which could occasionally get clogged due to the varying thicknesses of US coins.
