                        As a tinkerer, I am always looking to learn new skills and face new challenges. My Love of tinkering turned into a passion for electronics and software in high school when I built my 
                        first computer and learned to repair smartphones. I carried this passion to my college years at Northeastern University where I've developed skills ranging from python 
                        scripting to PCB design in pursuit of learning electronics and the software that powers them.
                        <br> <br>
                        At my university, I've been an active member of the rocketry projects in AerospaceNU since the fall of my freshman year. It was here that I built some of my first PCBs and dove deeper into firmware
                        development. I am proud to say my contributions towards our flight control systems have been successfully flight-tested. Recently, I've turned to teaching as the lead for the club's 
                        Intro to Rocketry: Avionics program as a way to instill my passion for avionics in new members.

                        Taking advantage of NEU's Co-op program, I've had the opportunity to work 6 months at Festo as a part of its life-tech division in Boston. Here, I learned about the product development cycle
                        and contributed to the research and development of innovative custom and off-the-shelf solutions. In particular, I made contributions toward the driver, HAL, and API layers of a reference design
                        liquid handler system. I also designed a few PCBs, including a prototype PCB for a low-cost, open-loop, pipette that was designed to fit in a 9mm pitch.
                        <br> <br>
                        As I develop my skills, my passion for electronics and software grows. I wish to use these skills in the aerospace or life-tech industry to solve problems and build innovative devices. <br>
